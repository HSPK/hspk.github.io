I am a Master's student in Wuhan University, supervised by Prof. [Libing Wu](mailto:wu@whu.edu.cn). I did my undergraduate study also in Wuhan University(2019-2023), where I received my Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security. I am currently working as a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), under the supervision of Dr. [Li Zhao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lizo/).

I am interested in research about Robotics, Embodied AI and Reinforcement Learning. Aim to build foundation models for embodied agents, enable them to learn from internet-scale data and generalize to real-world tasks. I am also interested in the intersection of AI and Cyber Security, especially in the field of Agent Security and Prompt Injection.

I am still in the early stage of my research career, and I am eager to learn more about these fields. If you have any suggestions or resources that you think might be helpful for me, please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:whxway@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hangxingwei).
